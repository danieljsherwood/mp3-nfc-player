# Implementing
This code is designed to make an MP3 cassette player using Arduino nano, DY-SV5W MP3 player, and PN532 NFC reader. The full circuit is described in XXX. 

# Requirements
Install the following libraries before use:

 - [Dy player](https://github.com/SnijderC/dyplayer)
 - [Elechouse PN532](https://github.com/elechouse/PN532) - you need PN532, PN532_SPI, and NDEF.
